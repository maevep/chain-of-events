        <h1>Chain of Events</h1>
        <h2><em>By Maeve Potter</em></h2>



        <p>
           The toddler's tooth falls out. It hits the floor and bounces into a cup of water. The mother drinks the water. The mother chokes on the tooth. The mother coughs up the tooth and it flies out the window. The tooth hits a man in the eye and he stumbles into the street. A passing car narrowly avoids the man, crashing into a street lamp. The street lamp topples over, and pulls on a string attached to it. The string runs in through the neighborâ€™s window and is attached to a toddler's tooth. The tooth is extracted from the mouth.
